# Breast-cancer-classification-
this project is about a deep  convolutional neural network for breast cancer screening exam classification, trained and evaluated on  on the public INbreast, MIAS and DSM  mammographies .The network achieves an AUC of 0.969 in predicting whether the tumor is benign or malignant in the breast.
A pre-processing step was applied to the images in order to enhance the performance of the system and, therefore, improve the results of the detection.
